#No Enumerable Extensions
Addon that lets you hide your installed extensions and avoid being fingerprinted based on them

You should also:
* make sure accept-langage header is generic (intl.accept_languages = en-us, en);
* disable webrtc (media.peerconnection.enabled = false);
* disable webgl (webgl.disabled = true);
* disable/defuse canvas (extension CanvasBlocker);
* disable/defuse referer (extension Smart Referer);
* hide fonts listing.
